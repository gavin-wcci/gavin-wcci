- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gavin-wcci
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in providing the best education for my students to find jobs as developers.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Unity, accessibility considerations for web development (and hopefully beyond in the process), and I'm always learning C#, JavaScript, and web design.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: If you are a student: Slack or email. If you aren't a student, @gavhensley on GitHub.
